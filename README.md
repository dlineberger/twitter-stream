twitter-stream
==============

Sample web application that tracks recently retweeted tweets.

To run, you need to have a working Node.js installation on your machine. Next, open server.js and add your own Twitter API keys. Then, type:

    node server.js
    
You can also specify the number of minutes to track retweets. The default value is 5 minutes. For a different value, type:

    node server.js <number-of-minutes>
